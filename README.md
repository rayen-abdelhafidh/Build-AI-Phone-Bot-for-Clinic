## Notes

- Your SQLite database (`calls.db`) is auto-created with the required tables: `departments`, `doctors`, `bookings`.
- The dashboard prevents adding departments or doctors with empty, whitespace, or numeric-only names.
- For local AI testing, you can mock AI responses or use open-source models.
- Update selectors in `booking.py` if the clinic website changes.
- All add/delete actions in the dashboard use AJAX for a smooth experience.
- **Automated booking is performed on:** [https://jtsmedicalcentre.com/appointments/](https://jtsmedicalcentre.com/appointments/)
